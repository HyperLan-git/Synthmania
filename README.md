# Synthmania
An 88key rythm game. Simple as that.
I got motivation for making this project after recieving my very own synth and getting it to work with a midi cable.
I also plan on composing electronic music (my favorite artist is probably camellia) but shh thats a secret.


# Installation
You will need to install :
- Vulkan and GLFW
- OpenAL with ALUT
- libremidi (just clone the repo in here)
- glslc
- boost
Imma keep the latest versions of those and make sure project compiles with them.

# Compilation
I have no clue what I'm doing but I thought it would be a good idea to make headers organized in a file system.
This means that you will have to -I every subfolder of include and the includes of every library used that is not immediately available to the compiler. You could also just put every header in the same folder and compile from there lol

Object files are now setup this is so cool not having to wait 1 min each time I add a space in the source code.

# Development
I'll probably put some screenshots of what the game looks like for people who don't want to/know how to compile and try the thing for themself. Or I'll actually do something right and code short scripts to detect your platform and install everything automatically.

Nah that's too much work I'd rather remake Synthesia using 200h of spare time just to avoid paying 30â‚¬.
